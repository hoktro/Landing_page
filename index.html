        <h2>A REAL-WORLD PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>Before we commence, let’s consider a problem. Imagine you are working in a
          programming team to come up with a simple video game that has plenty of player and
          they are shooting each other. Because of the customer’s requirement, your game may
          contains a bunch of elements such as players, bullets, magics, e.t.c and other attractive
          effects at the same time. Note that the events should be handled independently and
          smoothly. Your team has worked pretty hard to find out the following naive solution.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="section2" data-nav="Section 2">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>NAIVE SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>Obviously, you need define a class particle including all necessary attribution such
          as coordinate, name, speed, color and sprite of an object in the game. Secondly, the
          Game class responsible for driving game. In addition, there is a class makes game
          action such as fire or defend, which is unit class.</p>

    <section id="section3" data-nav="Section 3">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>Basically, the game is finished. Every needed functions are implemented and they
          work perfectly on your machine. However, after you sent your program to the tester,
          you received a rejected response. According to your tester, the game cannot be played
          so long on his machine. Particularly, after a certain time, the game is terminated and
          thrown bunch of errors. The discussion on what was happening took a significant
          time to find out the problem. It turns out that the tester’s computer hardware (i.e Main
          Memory) does not sufficient the memory cost of the game. It is clearly that the memory
          cost is extremely expensive if you have a enormous amount of elements.</p>

        <h2>FLYWEIGHT PATTERN</h2>
        <p>According to the book ”Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
          Software” by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, the
          intent of Flyweight Pattern is: ”Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained
          objects efficiently”.</p>
